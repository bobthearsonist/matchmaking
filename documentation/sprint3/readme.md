# 20190419
Attendance: Martin, Chris

Discussed open testing PR. Has been open for a while.
Discussed open match PR, waiting on fixing changes form review to hopefully fix the broken view.

Martin: the application that was published was Kristin's fork. The changes there need to be merged to master via PR. Work should not be done in the forks (please), we need to work from feature branches in the main repo.

Sprint kickoff/planning/retro was missed last week so we did it today. Will review on Sunday with missing members.
Retro:
Burndown chart looked really bad due to amount of work still in review. Lets please try to be prompt on reviewing open PRs so they can be merged on time.
Planning:
Scoped down the work for the sprint to match previous discussions with stakeholders. Focusing on match features and leaving groups and friends as follow on work if time allows. Also added more test coverage work.
