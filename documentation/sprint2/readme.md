Chris, Souarev, Martin

Martin expressed his contributions have been limited by the inability to use the project in an osx environment due to design decisions made by the team. he emphasized stating previously he was unable to develop in windows at the start of the project. he will continue to contribute with producing burndown charts and tracking the board as well as working to buddy code with other team members.

Saurav was able to get the app running locally. Suggested that we meet with professor and show him the current application to set expectations.

Chris added a match endpoint and pushed it to the repository

further match endpoint work

Decided to create a new card to work on refactoring the UI. This was outside of original sprint scope but due to the current rate of progress we thought it prudent.
