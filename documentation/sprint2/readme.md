Martin expressed he is unable to further contribute to development because the project was not written to work on osx due to design decisions made by the team. this was despite stating he was unable to develop in windows at the start of the project. he will continue to contribute with producing burndown charts and tracking the board as well as working to buddy code with other team members.

Saurav was able to get the app running locally. Suggested that we meet with professor and show him the current application to set expectations.

Chris added a match endpoint and pushed it to the repository
