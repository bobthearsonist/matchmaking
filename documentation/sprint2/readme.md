# Sprint 2

## Goal 

* retrieval of matched players

## Review

Overall the pace was consistent but the scope of the sprint expanded greatly adding additional testing and hosting the application, but despite this the tickets were mostly completed. Several tickets are still awaiting review however so the burdowns are largely skewed as that is technically counted as still in progress. The team needs to be better about revieiwing PRs.

To further complicate reporting the selected tool did not work well with a 3 week sprint. We are still having issues with trello tools after trying 3 different providers.

Chris, Sourav, Martin

Martin expressed his contributions have been limited by the inability to use the project in an osx environment due to design decisions made by the team. he emphasized stating previously he was unable to develop in windows at the start of the project. he will continue to contribute with producing burndown charts and tracking the board as well as working to buddy code with other team members.

Sourav was able to get the app running locally. Suggested that we meet with professor and show him the current application to set expectations.

Chris added a match endpoint and pushed it to the repository

further match endpoint work

Decided to create a new card to work on refactoring the UI. This was outside of original sprint scope but due to the current rate of progress we thought it prudent.
