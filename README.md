## Product Vision

## Definition of Ready

* Clear, succinct title decribes deliverable item
* Description expressed as a user story in "poem" form e.g. "As a ____, I want a ____, so that ____"
* Decription may also contain clarifying details like "store this in s3" or "use the following endpoint to get the data"
* Card represents identifiable single deliverable item of work
* Story points estimated in "level of effort" using the "fibonacci" method using the set [0.5,1,2,3,5]. Story points go in the first line of the card.

## Backlog Rules

The backlog is ranked by order to complete. The cards at the top of the backlog or sprint will be worked prior to the cards below them.

A card is done when it has moved through every swimlane in the board INLCUDING REVIEW.

When a member is done with their card they will take the next card at the top of the backlog. No exceptions unless discussed and agreed buy the team.

No member shall have more than one card at any one time. This results in a max number of "in flight" cards of 4.
