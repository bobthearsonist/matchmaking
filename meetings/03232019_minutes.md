Discussed some developers issues with environment setup
Discussed that the application is serving the view which may cause issues consuming it as a service and did not follow the design laid out on the board.
The initial application will be great for using with the demo, but it makes it hard to mutate the model. We are looking into how to iterate on that tomorrow.
All PRs merged and initial application comitted
